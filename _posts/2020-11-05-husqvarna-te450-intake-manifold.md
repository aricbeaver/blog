# Preface
The 2006 Husqvarna TE450 dual sport offroad motorcycle I own has an intake manifold that consistently breaks. It starts to let air into the engine which adjusts the air fuel mixture enough so the motorcycle does not run properly. This manifold has a bad reputation of failing and then in 2020 Husqvarna discontinued this part! I decided to reverse engineer the manifold to get everyone back ripping the trails!

# Fitment
The custom manifold will likely fit Husqvarna models SM/TC/TE with displacement of 250/450/510cc from years 2003 to 2007 according to OEM part numbers from [KTM Parts Pro](https://www.ktmpartspro.com/){:target="_blank"}. Some of the Husqvarna part numbers are listed below. This list may or may not cover all the relevant part numbers.

800099664 Union TE 250
8000A2121 Union TC 250
8000A5737, 8000A2977 Union 250

# Details
The intake manifold is custom machined from aluminum. One bolt on the left side of the motorcycle needs to be replaced with an recessed bolt so the bolt does not interfere with the intake tube. For the other two bolts the stock flange bolts can be used. The tube is custom made from nitrile hose that is 100% gas resistant. Two hose clamps replace the single hose clamp to attach the manifold to the tube and the tube to the carburetor. 

## What is included in the kit?
* Custom aluminum intake
* One recessed hex bolt
* Nitrile intake tube/hose
* Nitrile o-ring to seal against cylinder head
* Two hose clamps
